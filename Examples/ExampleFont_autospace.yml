# If you are migrating from G2 to G3, categories and subcategories are different. If you want to keep your spacing working the same way, please include G2 GlyphData.xml in your project.
# Otherwise you would need to update the config with new categories matching.
# Roll your own Glyph data: https://glyphsapp.com/learn/roll-your-own-glyph-data
# For Glyphs 3, Letter Subcategory is taken from case values (upper [1], smallCaps [3] and lowercase [2]). case value minor [4] is ignored.
# Glyphs categories can differ between Glyphs 2 and 3 versions. Please update your config accordingly
